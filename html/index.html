        <h2 id="greeting">Hello!</h2> 
        <p>
            I'm a distinguished honors graduate from Pontotoc High School 
            and currently attending Base Camp Coding Academy with a full-ride scholarship. 
            I’m training to become a full stack developer, learning nine different coding 
            languages and frameworks in less than a year. In a few years, I want to be 
            working my way up a successful and growing company while also learning more 
            software development skills as I grow. I want to be a part of something 
            that's making an impact and improving lives everyday.

                        for friends to join, and play with special gamemodes for a twist!
